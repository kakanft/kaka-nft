### ðŸ‘¾IntroductionðŸ‘¾
The game of "KAKA NFT World" is designed with 110 kinds of cards, which are divided into 1 to 10 levels according to the rarity of the cards. The higher the level, the higher the rarity and the smaller the circulation. KAKA game combined with blockchain technology realizes the non-issuance and rarity control of each card. Each card is bound to a pass based on blockchain technology. This pass will serve as the basis for the type and number of cards held by each player, effectively preventing the problem of forged cards. The entire game issued 574.31 million cards, and in the process of online games, as a large number of players compete against cards, there will be consumption and burning. Therefore, the circulation of cards in the entire market will become increasingly scarce.

The card game itself is very collectible, competitive, and fun. â€œKAKA NFT World" will combine the core gameplay of the entire game to launch physical cards, DAPP online games based on blockchain technology, exclusive game apps, and e-sports events.
